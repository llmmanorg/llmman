/// (tests/launch_e2e.rs's `spawn_with_timeout`) spawns `llmman run` with
/// piped stdout/stderr to capture its output live, and that child's own
/// `try_wait()`-detected exit was always reported correctly and promptly
/// — the hang was in the *next* step, `stdout_thread`/`stderr_thread`'s

/// `Ok(0)` (EOF). A pipe only reaches EOF once *every* handle to its
/// write end is closed — not just the one held by the process the reader
/// thinks it's reading from.
///
/// On Windows, any `CreateProcess` call that redirects a child's stdio via
/// a handle (a `File`, or another pipe — exactly what `ensure_server`
/// below does, redirecting the daemon's stdout/stderr to its log file)
/// requires `bInheritHandles = TRUE`, and that flag does not selectively
/// inherit only the handles you asked to redirect — it inherits *every*
/// handle in the parent's own handle table that's currently marked
/// inheritable. `llmman run`'s own stdout/stderr handles — received from
/// the test harness above specifically so they could be piped and
/// captured, which requires them to be inheritable in the first place —
/// are exactly such handles. So when `llmman run` calls `ensure_server`
/// and spawns the detached daemon below, that daemon process — which is
/// deliberately left running indefinitely — ends up with its own
/// duplicate, still-open handle to `llmman run`'s original stdout/stderr
/// pipes, even though its own stdio was separately, correctly redirected
/// to the log file. The pipe's write end therefore never fully closes,
/// the test harness's reader thread blocks on `read()` forever waiting
/// for an EOF that can now never come, and the *entire* E2E job times out
/// 45 minutes later with no error of its own — indistinguishable from
/// there being no bug at all up to that point, since `llmman run` itself
/// already exited successfully.
///
/// The fix: explicitly clear the inheritable flag on this process's own
/// three standard handles, once, as early as possible (see `main.rs`) —
