//! The models.dev provider catalog, fetched at runtime rather than baked
//! into this binary, so a provider models.dev gains tomorrow works
//! without an llmman release.
//!
//! opencode resolves the same catalog the same way, through its own
//! mirror of it (`packages/core/src/models-dev.ts` GETs
//! `models.opencode.ai/api.json`, byte-identical to `models.dev`'s own
//! today). llmman reads the upstream directly: a mirror is one more
//! thing that can disagree, and llmman has no say in what opencode's
//! serves.
//!
//! Only a *subset* is exposed as [`Provider`]s, because `llmman serve`
//! reaches an upstream exactly one way: an HTTPS POST of an OpenAI Chat
//! Completions body with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (see
//! `Target::Remote` in `cmd::serve`). An entry is offered only if llmman
//! can be *sure* it speaks that:
//!
//! * its `npm` driver is one of [`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_NPM`], as opposed to
//!   `@ai-sdk/anthropic` (Messages wire format),
//!   `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` (SigV4 signing), `@ai-sdk/google-vertex`
//!   (GCP credentials), and the rest;
//! * it has one concrete `https` base URL. models.dev leaves `api` unset
//!   where the SDK hardcodes the endpoint — recovered from
//!   [`BUILTIN_ENDPOINTS`] — and templated (`${VAR}`) where it is
//!   per-account, which llmman has nothing to interpolate from;
//! * exactly one of its `env` entries is an API key. Multi-variable auth
//!   (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, ...) is not "one
//!   bearer token".
//!
//! Everything filtered out is deliberately *absent* rather than
//! half-supported: a provider llmman offers is one it can actually reach.
