//! `llmman launch` — launch AI agent integrations backed by llmman serve.
//!
//! Mirrors `ollama launch`: sets integration-specific environment variables

//! `--provider` extends that to models llmman does not serve itself, from
//! the same models.dev catalog opencode resolves its providers from (see
//! [`crate::providers`]). It does not change the shape above: the
//! integration is still pointed at `llmman serve`, which forwards upstream

//! integrations are configured, whether or not the weights are local.
//!
//! `--overflow-provider`/`--overflow-model` hand the integration one
//! reference naming the local `--model` and a hosted one, and the daemon
//! picks a side per request (see [`crate::hybrid`]); the integration
//! never learns two are involved.
