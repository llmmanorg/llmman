/// — per launch, never persisted — the same way the other launchers hand
/// over their base URLs. Without it Talos would talk to `:11434`, not to
/// `llmman serve`.
///
/// Hands off to `talos chat`, an interactive session in this terminal
/// where actions the kernel classes as needs-human wait for the person
/// at it. A leading `ask` after `--` runs Talos's one-turn command
/// instead (`llmman launch talos --model m -- ask "…"`; answer on
/// stdout), which is what the e2e test drives — `chat` counts a terminal
/// as attended only when stdin and stdout both are one.
///
/// Two things this leaves to Talos on purpose. The terminal has to be in
/// its allowlist (`cli:<uid>` in `TALOS_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS`, a policy
/// key llmman does not touch); a fresh install refuses with the exact
/// line to add. And a model picked with `/model` inside a session
/// persists in Talos's event log and outranks its env file on the next
/// start — Talos reports the model it runs, and `/model` in the session
/// changes it. Neither is llmman's to override: both are the kernel
/// deciding who may talk to it and with what.
///
/// `--model` is required: with none, Talos would start on whatever its
/// env file or shipped default names, which is not what the caller asked
/// for. An exported `TALOS_MODEL_PROVIDER`/`TALOS_MODEL` that disagrees
/// with the launch is refused before this function writes anything: it
/// outranks the env file in Talos's own loader, so the launch would
/// otherwise save and report one model while the process runs another.
/// That guarantee is local to this function, not the daemon: `run()`
/// above already calls `ensure_server`/`ensure_model_pulled` for every
