# Hosted providers

`--provider` points llmman at a model it doesn't serve itself, from
`launch`, from `run`, and from `list`:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
llmman providers                                    # which providers, and is the key set
llmman list --provider openrouter                   # its models, and $/Mtok in and out
llmman run --provider openrouter qwen/qwen3-coder   # chat with one directly
llmman launch opencode --provider openrouter --model qwen/qwen3-coder
```

Requests still go through `llmman serve`; `--provider` changes where the
daemon forwards them, not who the client talks to, so local and hosted
models share one endpoint and one integration config.

## The catalog

The provider list comes from [models.dev](https://models.dev), the
catalog `opencode` uses, so a new provider needs no llmman release. It
is cached for 24 hours and a stale copy is used when the fetch fails.

All four commands read it from the daemon over
[`/llmman/providers`](api.md#llmmans-own-api), so the cache outlives any
one command and the key status reported is the daemon's.

## API keys

The API key comes from the variable models.dev names for that provider,
or — when that is unset — from `~/.config/llmman/llmman.conf`, keyed by
provider id:

```toml
[providers.openrouter]
api_key = "sk-or-..."
```

or, equivalently, `llmman config set providers.openrouter.api_key sk-or-...`.

Either way it travels per request; it is never written into an
integration's config.
A file carrying one must be `chmod 600` or its keys are ignored with a
warning; an `export` overrides it. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md#provider-api-keys).

`--provider` needs a local `llmman serve`. The daemon is plain HTTP with
no authentication, so `run` and `launch` never send a key to a remote
`LLMMAN_HOST`, and a daemon bound off loopback never spends its own key
for a caller that presented none. (`providers` and `list --provider`
read the catalog only and work against any daemon.)

## Hybrid model pairs

`--overflow-provider` and `--overflow-model` pair the local `--model`
with a hosted one under a single name, and `llmman serve` picks a side
per request:

```sh
llmman launch opencode --model gemma4 --overflow-provider anthropic --overflow-model claude-sonnet-5
llmman run gemma4 --overflow-provider anthropic --overflow-model claude-sonnet-5
```

Both halves travel as one reference,
`llmman.hybrid/gemma4,anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, in the same `"model"`
field an ordinary name uses, so a pair works from any client on every
inference endpoint (`/api/show`, `/api/pull` and the other store
operations take a plain model name). The local half is resolved and pulled as `--model` always
is; the hosted half is validated and authenticates exactly as a bare
`--provider` model does, so the same integration rules apply. The two
cannot be combined with `--provider`, since the local half has to be
local.

Which side serves a request:

1. **`x-llmman-route: local` or `cloud`** on the request wins. Any other
   value, or the header given twice, is a `400`, never a guess; a blank
   value counts as absent.
2. **Otherwise, size.** A request larger than the local context can hold
   goes to the provider. The budget is four bytes per token of the
   daemon's context size (`LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH`); `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES`
   sets it directly, `0` turns the rule off. A request that declares no
   `Content-Length` stays local.
3. **Otherwise, local.**

Local is the default because the two mistakes are not equal: a worse
local answer is recoverable, a request sent to someone else's servers is
not. Every request logs which way it went and why; the log, not the
response's `model` field, is the record of the side.

The byte budget is an estimate. If a chat, completion, Responses or
Messages request it kept local is then refused by the local backend as
larger than its context, the daemon sends it to the hosted half instead,
before anything has reached the client. Without that an agent would see the local model's context error,
compact its history and stay local. A `local` pin is never overridden
this way, and `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES=0` disables only the size rule,
not this retry.

`/v1/audio/transcriptions` cannot forward to a provider, so a pair takes
its local half there whatever the body size. An unload (`keep_alive: 0`)
or a startup preload of a pair acts on its local half, the only one that
loads.

## Integrations

`llmman launch` with no arguments lists these and whether each is
installed:

| Name | Integration | `--provider` |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `claude` | Claude Code | yes |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | yes |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI | yes (below) |
| `aider` | Aider | yes |
| `qwen` | Qwen Code | yes |
| `hermes` | Hermes Agent | yes, but the daemon holds the key (below) |
| `gemini` | Gemini CLI | no: llmman cannot confirm the key would come here rather than go to Google |
| `cline` | Cline | no: it picks its own model rather than taking llmman's |
| `kimi` | Kimi Code CLI | no: it picks its own model rather than taking llmman's |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot CLI (`gh`) | no: it has no way to send a key |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw | no: it only takes a model during first-run onboarding |

Any extra arguments after `--` are forwarded to the integration's own CLI.

`hermes` is configured through a file on disk, so it can't carry a key
per request; `llmman serve` needs one of its own, spent only for a
loopback daemon and never for a cross-site browser request. On a shared
machine prefer an integration that sends its own key.

`codex` speaks only OpenAI's Responses API, which most providers lack
(`anthropic` 404s it, `opencode` 500s it for non-OpenAI models). The
daemon tries the provider first and, on a 404/405/501 or 5xx, translates
the request to a chat completion and the reply back, tool calls included.
Providers that have the API (`openai`, `groq`, `openrouter`) are used
natively; any other 4xx is relayed as-is.
